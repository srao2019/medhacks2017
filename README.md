Less paperwork, more patient care

Problem: Inefficiency of EMT-ER Communication

In the fast paced environment of the emergency room, physicians and staff need to be able to be in immediate contact with incoming emergency medical services to provide patients with immediate and quality care. A staff member at the desk would get a call from a paramedic with the patient information, but they have no visible record of this and cannot tell exactly how far away the ambulance is in real time. In addition, paramedics having to write manual records takes time away from patient care and leaves room for error if they choose to wait until after. 

Objective:
Our solution aims to reduce the paperwork that paramedics need to complete, and increase the quality of patient care to improve ER communication and efficiency. 

Design:
We provide a map interface for hospitals to use to locate ambulances that are coming to their hospital as well as have access to the most recent information about the patients in those ambulances, including vitals, risk conditions, etc. This gives the staff time to notify a physician ahead of time if a critical patient is coming in. The web app also allows paramedics to enter in information about the patient that immediately becomes visible so the hospital can access the information. 

Current Status & Accomplishments:
This project was worked on in collaboration with 4 other students at Medhacks 2017. At the demo day, after 36 hours of programming, we presented this version of the project. It has the form and map interface implemented using Google Maps Api for Javascript. The web app stores all the patient information that is inputted from a form by the paramedics into a sql database and then queries that information to build markers on the map. Learned to use the Google Maps Api as well as improved skills in PHP, Javascript, HTML, and SQL. There were issues that we ran into with tracking the geolocation, so the coordinates were tentatively hard coded in and a set of fake data was put in locally for the purpose of the demo. 

Future Goals:
In the future we hope to add voice recognition to prevent paramedics from having to manually enter in all the patient information. In addition, we hope to be able to integrate the patient database with hospitals' EMR. We also hope to add a feature for paramedics to update a patient's record with the most recent vitals so hospitals can see those vitals in real time. 

Submitted and Demoed as a part of Medhacks 2017.
